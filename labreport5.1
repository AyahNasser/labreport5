**Researching Commands**
 - Chosen Command is (grep).
 
 - grep command is in command line searches for words in a file . 
 
 - 1) -i
 The command line -i option is a kind of a command line option that ignores the case sensitivity when searching for a pattern. 
 This command line is helpful when searching for something in a file, and you want all the words in lower and upper case. Because this command line
 will not distinguish between uppercase and lowercase. 
 - For example, in the screenshot below, I wanted to look for the word history in the HistoryJapan.txt file, and as we can see, that I wrote the History 
 with all lowercases, but it did show the uppercase words of History. 
 
 - a) Using -i the command-line and its output Example 1:
 
  ````
 ayahsmacbook.@Ayahss-MBP berlitz1 % grep -i "history" HistoryJapan.txt 
        A Brief History
        Prehistory and Early Chronicles
        of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and
        At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for

  - b) Using -i the command-line and its output Example 2: 
  ````
ayahsmacbook.@Ayahss-MBP berlitz1 % grep -i "according to the earliest" History
Japan.txt
        According to the earliest official accounts, the
  ````
  In this example, I wanted to look up the sentence in the txt file, however, I was not sure if the sentence was written in uppercase letters or
  lowercase, so I just wrote the sentence I remembered, and it gave me where the sentence did appear and how it was actually written. 
  
 - This is very useful because it saves time to go over the whole text to exactly match how the sentence or word was written to search it. Also, I found this interesting and helpful information from the lab tasks, and trying the command-line by myself, and chatGPT. 
 
 
 
 - 2) -c 
 This command-line Shows how many a word appear in a text file, and again it is not case sensitive, which means I can write a word in lower or upper 
 case, and it will still give me how many times this specific word appeared. 
 
 - a) First example is a code block of how I wrote the terminal and the output. 
 
 ````
 ayahsmacbook.@Ayahss-MBP berlitz1 % grep -c "official" HistoryJapan.txt
 3
````
Here, I wanted to see how many times the word "official" appeared in the text file, and this is helpful again because it saves so much time, instead
of counting each word in the terminal. 

- b) Second example is looking for the word "Hello" in a the WhatToGreek text file. 
````
ayahsmacbook.@Ayahss-MacBook-Pro berlitz1 % grep -c "Hello" WhatToGreek.txt 
0
````
Here I wanted to look for the word Hello in the text file (WhatToGreek), and the output was zero, which means the word did not appear in the text file.
- This command-line is helpful because it saves you so much time counting how many times a word appeared without having to go over all of the text file. 
Also, this becomes even more helpful when the text files get larger. Also, I found this interesting and helpful information from the lab tasks, and trying the command-line by myself, and chatGPT. 
 

- 3) -l
This command-line shows where a specific word appeared in differenet files, and it prints the names of the files thta have the word. Moreover, even if the word appeared more than once, the file name will be printed only once.  

- a) Here is an example of me trying to find where the word "Official" appeared in so many files. This is helpful because it is fast and it gives you a list of where the word appeared between so many files. 

````
ayahsmacbook.@Ayahss-MBP berlitz1 % grep -l "Official" *.txt
WhatToHongKong.txt
WhereToFrance.txt
WhereToMadrid.txt
`````
- The syntax to write the command was ```grep -l "Official" *.txt```, and the output was ```WhatToHongKong.txt WhereToFrance.txt WhereToMadrid.txt ``` which are the files where this word appeared. 

- b) The second example is trying to find all the files in a directory that contain a certain pattern. 
````

`````
- Here, the command will search for lines that consist of only one or more digits in all files in the directory, then the command will print the names of all the files that contain the specified pattern. 
- This command-line is helpful because it helps you to quickly find a certain pattern through all the files in the directory without having to go through all the files one by one which again saves time and effort. Also, I found this interesting and helpful information from the lab tasks, and trying the command-line by myself, and chatGPT. 
 



- 4) -w
This command-line is an option with the grep command which matches only whole words where it will search in files in the current directory and try to find the matching whole words. 
- a) First Example, trying to find the word "Official" is the (HistoryJapan.txt) text file. 
`````
ayahsmacbook.@Ayahss-MacBook-Pro berlitz1 % grep -w "official" HistoryJapan.txt
        According to the earliest official accounts, the
        cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated
        Nikko. Combining Shinto ritual with official Buddhist conformity, they
`````
- The output of trying to find the word (Official) in the (HistoryJapan.txt) text file gives the content of where the whole word appeared in the text file. 
  
- b) Second example here I was trying to find the matching words that have part of the word I am searching. 
`````
ayahsmacbook.@Ayahss-MacBook-Pro berlitz1 % grep -w "Offici" HistoryJapan.txt
`````

- In this example, there was not output; although I know that the word "official" appears in the HistoryJapan.txt file, the command-line did not give output because I am only searching part of the word which is "Offici" which is now the whole word. 
- The -w command-line is helpful if you are trying to be very specific and exact with what you are searching because it will only give you the exact (the whole word) you are looking for in a text file.  Also, I found this interesting and helpful information from the lab tasks, and trying the command-line by myself, and chatGPT.
